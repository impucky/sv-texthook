- Copies in-game text to the clipboard for usage with [Yomitan](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan) and a texthook page like [Renji's](https://renji-xd.github.io/texthooker-ui/) or [this one from TMW](https://learnjapanese.moe/texthooker.html)
- The mod needs more thorough testing, but it should be enough for language learners to get started with SV.
- Currently NPC dialogue, the quest log, daily quests, and random text like the TV and signs are getting copied.
- The intro cutscene is not copied but it's easy enough to find a transcript.
